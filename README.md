This repository contains all the projects I have worked on while learning to program in Java, Python, and C#. It also includes resources I have used along the way and found useful.


## Tic-Tac-Toe
A game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments. Each player tries to get a row of Xs or Os before the opponent does. It has a GUI with customizable window and grid size.

## Snake
A game in which the player maneuvers a snake whilst trying to eat apples. The more apples eaten the longer the snake becomes, increasing the difficulty.

## Minesweeper
Minesweeper is single-player logic-based game played on a rectangular board whose object is to locate a predetermined number of randomly-placed "mines" in the shortest possible time by clicking on "safe" squares while avoiding the squares with mines.
